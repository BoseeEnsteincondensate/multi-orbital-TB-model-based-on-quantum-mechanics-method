This model created for more effective calculation for Single Walled Armchair Carbon Nanotubes(SWACNTS). It's based on traditional Tight Binding Model, including complete sp2 orbital, and correction for the bond changes. 
Based on quantum mechanics, it included wave funciton decay for the correction of bond when using zone folding to create SWACNTS, and uses Slater-Koster method to calculate all the orbitals in SWACNT,
considering both orthogonal and nonorthogonal orbital to made a better prediction of electronic structure.
